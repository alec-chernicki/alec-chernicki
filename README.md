### Hi there 👋

I'm a business-minded software engineer with a specialization in JavaScript development. I currently work on the Client Foundations team at Netflix, supporting shared needs of our consumer-facing applications. Previously I worked at Disney Streaming and helped scale the Disney+ web teams from launch to millions of subscribers. I'm passionate about diversity in tech and growing empathetic, driven engineering teams. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exploring coffee shops, and spending time with my corgi, Arthur.

I'm passionate about front-end tooling and building things that bring people together.
