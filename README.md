### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a business-minded software engineer with a specialization in web development. Most recently I served as an Architect at Disney Streaming, guiding the overarching technical vision, strategy, and execution for the teams building Disney+, Star+, and Hulu. I'm passionate about diversity in tech and growing empathetic, driven engineering teams. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exploring coffee shops, and spending time with my corgi, Arthur.

I'm passionate about front-end tooling and building things that bring people together.
